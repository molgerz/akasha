# 09 — Security & privacy

## What is cryptographically guaranteed

- **Authorship**: every revision is signed with the key behind its npub. Nobody
  — not even the relay — can produce content in someone else's name.
- **Integrity**: the event `id` is a hash over content and tags. Changing an
  event after the fact is impossible; only a new revision is.
- **Order**: `parent-rev` anchors every revision to its predecessor.

## What is explicitly not guaranteed

- **Completeness**: a relay can withhold events. Partial mitigation: NIP-29
  timeline references (`previous`) would make gaps detectable, and the app could
  then say "history may be incomplete" instead of showing a smooth list.
  Limitation: `groups_relay` does not implement timeline references according to
  its README, so it does not check the tag — and we do not write it yet. Gap
  detection therefore remains a client-side heuristic over `parent-rev` chains
  with missing links.
- **Confidentiality**: a `private` NIP-29 group is *access-restricted*, not
  encrypted. The relay operator reads everything in plaintext.
  **Decision (confirmed):** that is fine for this use case — the relay belongs
  to the company or the admin, and the trust model matches a self-hosted wiki.
  Consequence for the UI: no padlock icon and no wording that suggests E2EE.
  Instead, literally: "members and the relay operator can see this content."
  E2EE stays deliberately out of scope; it would also be incompatible with
  relay-enforced permissions and full-text search.
- **Deletion**: NIP-09 is a request. Once published, content may survive on
  copies. UI wording: "request deletion". The client honours a request only for
  the requester's own revision, keeps the revision as a tombstone and skips it
  in the chain, the diff and blame — the relay we run stores the `kind 5`
  but does not delete the revision, so a later read would otherwise show it
  again.
- **Timestamps**: `created_at` is set by the client and therefore manipulable.
  Ordering primarily follows the `parent-rev` chain; the clock is for display.

## Client-side attack surface

| Risk | Countermeasure |
|---|---|
| XSS through Markdown from arbitrary npubs | `rehype-sanitize` with a strict allowlist, no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, no raw HTML, no `javascript:` links |
| Images/iframes used as trackers | **Implemented:** images from foreign origins are only loaded on click ("load image from example.com"), attachments from our own Blossom server load directly. No iframes |
| Forged `h` tags (an event from another group smuggled in) | Checked after loading: `h` must match the open space, otherwise the event is discarded |
| Forgetting to verify signatures | Verification is enforced in the data layer, not optional per call |
| Impersonation via display names | The npub is always shown alongside; the member badge only appears for entries in `39002` |
| Spam in open spaces | Relay rate limits + moderated deletion (`9005`) + a "members only" UI filter |
| Key theft through the app | No handling of nsec at all. NIP-07/NIP-46 only |

## Privacy note for users

An npub is a permanent pseudonym: everything a person posts is linkable across
relays. For teams where npubs map to real names, that effectively means a public
activity history. This belongs on the app's onboarding page, not in the fine
print. **Open:** there is no onboarding page yet.
